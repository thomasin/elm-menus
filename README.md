hello!

sorry on a bit of a crunch so i still need to do the docs

this is work on nice and transferable dropdowns in elm, that have easily managed focus & accessibility
doesn't lock you in to a particular drop down html structure or styling method, and you can keep your dropdown options & selection in any type you want
designed to be re-interfaced and used as part of your app's design system instead of drop-in
see examples/ folder for examples. they also run as an app so i will try get it running at a url
at the moment just exposes the most basic menu presets that require less configuration/have sensible defaults
